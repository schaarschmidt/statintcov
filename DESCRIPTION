Description: For linear models with one treatment factor and one covariate, simultaneous confidence intervals for between-treatment-contrasts over a prespecified grid of covariate values can be computed. For use in linear or generalized linear models, matrices of linear combinations for multiple pairwise between-treatment  comparisons can be computed that can be used for plug-in into the linfct argument of glht, package multcomp.
