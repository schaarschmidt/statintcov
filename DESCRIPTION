Description: For linear models with one treatment factor and one covariate, simultaneous confidence intervals for between-treatment-contrasts over a prespecified grid of covariate values can be computed. For use in linear or generalized linear models, matrices of linear combinations for multiple pairwise between-treatment comparisons can be computed which can be used for plug-in into the linfct argument of glht, package multcomp, or the gsci.ratio function in mratios.
